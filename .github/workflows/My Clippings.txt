When we first gravitated to the dismal world of compulsive sex, most of us felt excited and sickened. And then we found ourselves sneaking back - again and yet again. It was as if we had at last found a place where all our inner loathing could come into play, so that in some way we were finally "at home."

We begin to accept that our sexuality should be no more an excuse for self-pity than for self-blame. We renounce any sense of gay "exceptionality," and come to terms with homophobia , our own and other people's, and the damage it's done us. We accept that we're human beings like everybody else, with the same rights, the same privileges, and the same responsibilities.

Since most of the placebo studies show that a single thought could activate the body’s autonomic nervous system and produce significant physiological changes, then you’re regulating your internal world by simply associating a thought with an emotion. All of your subconscious, autonomic systems are being reinforced neurochemically by the familiar feelings and bodily sensations related to your fear—and your biology perfectly reflects it.

Second, if your expectation is that your future will be like your past, then you are not only thinking in the past, but also selecting a known future based only on your past and emotionally embracing that event until your body (as the unconscious mind) believes that it’s living in that future in the present moment. All of your attention is on a known, predictable reality, which causes you to limit any new choices, behaviors, experiences, and emotions. You’re unconsciously forecasting your future by physiologically clinging to the past.

Third, if you assign meaning or conscious intention to an action, the result is amplified. What you’re telling yourself on a daily basis (in this case, that you’re not a good speaker and that public speaking elicits a panic reaction) is what has meaning to you. You’ve become susceptible to your own autosuggestions. And if your present knowledge is based on your own conclusions from past experiences, then without any new knowledge, you’ll always keep creating the outcome that’s equal to your mind. Change your meaning and change your intention, and just as the hotel maids in the study from the last chapter did, you change the results.

The crisis begins with the knowledge that we are different and awareness of our ASD condition, and it ends when we have accepted, and feel comfortable with, our new self-identity. Between the start and end of this process, for many if not most of us, there will be some tough days – depression, desperation, sleepless nights and suicidal thinking – but remember to follow the light until the end of the tunnel.

Integrity is especially important to autistic people, so we should avoid people who try to corrupt us (or take us away from our ‘soul’s path’) at all costs. This is the main reason why autistic adults should be very discerning about our choice of friends. Remember, we must have purpose, meaning and positive intent to make the world a better place.
